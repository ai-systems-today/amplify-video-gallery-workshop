While no application is really ever done, we've certainly come a long way toward building a shareable photo albums web app! 

Here's a reminder of everything we accomplished. We:

- Started with a simple React web app

- Added user authentication with a complete sign up and sign in flow

- Created a GraphQL API to securely manage photo albums backed by DynamoDB tables

- Added the ability to create and view albums

- Added the ability to upload photos to an album, complete with automatic thumbnail creation

- Introduced 'load more...' pagination for albums with many photos

- Added automatic label detection for photos

- Added the ability to search for all photos for a given label (scoped by each user's album permissions)

- Built a production-ready version of the app and deployed it to S3 for web hosting

The backend for our photo albums app is entirely serverless, which means it's extremely cost efficient, scalable, and highly available thanks to services from AWS. 

Not bad for a few hours of work! 

Please give yourself a **huge pat on the back** for making it all the way to the end!
